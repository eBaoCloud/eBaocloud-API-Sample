       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use top(1) instead.

       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due to the many standards and ps
       implementations that this ps is compatible with.

       Note that "ps -aux" is distinct from "ps aux".  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that "ps -aux" print all processes owned by a user named "x", as well as printing all processes that would
       be selected by the -a option.  If the user named "x" does not exist, this ps may interpret the command as "ps aux" instead and print a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid in
       transitioning old scripts and habits.  It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.

       By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as the invoker.  It displays the process ID
       (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by
       default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the executable name.  You can override this with the
       PS_FORMAT environment variable. The use of BSD-style options will also change the process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may
       be described as setting the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options
       are described as being "identical" below, so -M will be considered identical to Z and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added to the set of processes to be displayed.  A
       process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.

EXAMPLES
       To see every process on the system using standard syntax:
          ps -e
          ps -ef
          ps -eF
          ps -ely
